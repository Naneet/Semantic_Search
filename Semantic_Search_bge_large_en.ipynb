It\\nheld that there is no distinction between a declaration of unconstitutionality brought about by lack\\nof legislative power from a declaration of unconstitutionality brought about by reason of\\nabridgement of Fundamental Rights; that both these declarations of unconstitutionality go to the\\nroot of the power itself and there is no real distinction between them; and when the law making\\npower of the State is restricted by a written fundamental law, then any law enacted and opposed to\\nthe fundamental law is in excess of the legislative authority and is thus a nullity.

It stands concluded by the majority decision in Kesava Madhava Menon v.\\nState of Bombay13. The minority view there was that the word \"void\" had the same\\nmeaning as \"repeal\" and therefore a statute which came into clash with fundamental\\nrights stood obliterated from the statute-book altogether, and that such a statute was\\nvoid ab initio. The majority however held that the word \"void\" in Article 13(1), so far\\nas existing laws were concerned, could not be held to obliterate them from the\\nstatute-book, and could not make such laws void altogether, because in its opinion,\\nArticle 13 had not been given any retrospective effect. The majority however held that\\nafter the coming into force of the Constitution the effect of Article 13(1) on such\\nrepugnant laws was that it nullified them, and made them ineffectual and nugatory\\nand devoid of any legal force or binding effect. It was further pointed out in one of the\\njudgments representing the majority view, that the American rule that if a statute is\\nrepugnant to the Constitution the statute is void from its birth, has no application to\\ncases concerning obligations incurred or rights accrued in accordance with an\\nexisting law that was constitutional in its inception, but that if any law was made\\nafter 26th January, 1950, which was repugnant to the Constitution, then the same\\nrule shall have to be followed in India as followed in America.

Thus, in this situation, there is no\\nscope for introducing terms like \"relatively void\" coined by American Judges in\\nconstruing a Constitution which is not drawn up in similar language and the\\nimplications of which are not quite familiar in this country.\\n11. We are also not able to endorse the opinion expressed by our learned Brother,\\nVenkatarama Ayyar that a declaration of unconstitutionality brought about by lack of\\nlegislative power stands on a different footing from a declaration of\\nunconstitutionality brought about by reason of abridgement of fundamental rights.\\nWe think that it is not a correct proposition that constitutional provisions in Part III\\nof our Constitution merely operate as a check on the exercise of legislative power. It is\\naxiomatic that when the law- making power of a State is restricted by a written\\nfundamental law, then any law enacted and opposed to the fundamental law is in\\nexcess of the legislative authority and is thus a nullity. Both these declarations of\\nunconstitutionality go to the root of the power itself and there is no real distinction\\nbetween them. They represent but two aspects of want of legislative power. The\\nlegislative power of Parliament and the State Legislatures as conferred by Articles\\n245 and 246 of the Constitution stands curtailed by the fundamental rights chapter of\\nConstitution. A mere reference to the provisions of Article 13(2) and Articles 245 and\\n246 is sufficient to indicate that there is no competency in Parliament or a State\\nLegislature to make a law which comes into clash with Part III of the Constitution\\nafter the coming into force of the Constitution. Article 13(2) is in these terms:\\n\"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred\\nby this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of\\nthe contravention, be void.\"\\nThis is a clear and unequivocal mandate of the fundamental law prohibiting the State from making\\nany laws which come into conflict with Part III of the Constitution. The authority thus conferred by\\nArticles 245 and 246 to make laws subjectwise in the different legislatures is qualified by the\\ndeclaration made in Article 13(2). That power can only be exercised subject to the prohibition\\ncontained in Article 13(2). On the construction of Article 13(2) there was no divergence of opinion\\nbetween the majority and the minority in 31 of 36 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:029128-DB\\nCWP-17064-2017 and connected matters Kesava Madhava Menon v. State of Bombay13. It was only\\non the construction of Article 13(1) that the difference arose because it was felt that that article could\\nnot retrospectively invalidate laws which when made were constitutional according to the\\nConstitution then in force.\"\\nAjay Kumar Singla & Ors vs State Of Punjab & Ors on 16 February, 2023\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178533926/\\n30\\n',\n",
